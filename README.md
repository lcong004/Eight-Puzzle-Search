### How to start this tool?

To run this tool, you need to first change your directory to where the main.py python file is stored, and run $$python main.py$$ to run it. 

### How to run test cases?

The first required element after you run the tool is the initial state. To enter the initial state, you need to enter one row by one row. For the three numbers in each row, you need to type in the numbers 1-8 and the underscore symbol _ for the blank, between each of the three numbers, you need to add a space between them. After entering each row, you can simply press Enter to continue with the next row.

The second required element after you entered the initial state is the algorithm you want to use. You can type 1 for uniform cost search, 2 for A* search with misplaced tiles heuristic, 3 for A* search with Euclidean distance heuristic.

After selecting the two elements, the program will be run and the explored states with be present.
